    "Confirmed Integer Overflow in `vhost_vsock_alloc_skb` leading to DoS on 32-bit architectures.",
    "Confirmed Resource Exhaustion (DoS) due to unbounded `send_pkt_queue` growth if guest manipulates credit window.",
    "Analyzed race conditions in setup/teardown paths (release vs cancel_pkt, start vs worker) and found locking/RCU usage to be robust.",
    "Verified packet handling logic (splitting, header parsing) against type confusion and logic errors."
