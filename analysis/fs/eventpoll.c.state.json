    "Loop detection and refcount/lifetime handling across nested epolls rely on RCU snapshots and can race with concurrent epoll_ctl, risking recursion and stale pointers",
    "Wakeup source management and poll callback teardown lack synchronization, leaving opportunities for UAF and info leaks when EPOLLWAKEUP is toggled or deleted",
    "Busy-poll and resource accounting paths (max_user_watches, busy_poll_budget, wakeup_source creation) allow unprivileged users to exhaust CPU or memory without strong quotas"
