    "mmap flag validation and sealing rely on single-pass checks, leaving races for MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE, memfd seals, and MAP_SYNC semantics",
    "ASLR and resource controls are weakly enforced via writable sysctls (legacy_va_layout, mmap_rnd_bits, max_map_count) and one-time reserve calculations",
    "MAP_DROPPABLE, execute-only pkeys, and path_noexec interactions introduce side channels and TOCTOU paths for unexpected exec or info leaks"
