    "Fast-path timestamp and header prediction logic accepts state changes before full validation, exposing PAWS, ECN, and RTT manipulation risks.",
    "Receive window growth and sndbuf expansion rely on unbounded driver/module inputs, enabling memory inflation or policy bypass.",
    "BPF sock_ops invocation under socket lock and busy-poll contexts can deadlock or bypass ownership checks, warranting rate limiting and synchronization.",
    "Discard and fragstolen paths free skbs/frags without coordinating with shared references, risking UAF/double-free under offload and GRO scenarios."
